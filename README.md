# MSFG
Malicious SVG file generator to exploit XXE vulnerability

When the SVG file produced with this tool is uploaded to the website, it prints the contents of the file in the path you specify to an SVG file. In this way, if you can view the file you uploaded, you can see the content of the target file.

NOTE: You may need to change the size of the SVG file depending on the contents of the file.
